# Modeling-Earthquake-Damage

## 1. Overview and Objective
Based on aspects of building location and construction aspects, our goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The damage grade is an ordinal variable where 1 represents low damage, 2 represents medium damage, and 3 represents complete distruction. 

## 2. About the Data
The dataset contains valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics. There are 38 features with respect to each buildings and damage grade label (indicating level of damage). The training data has 260k+ records.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Inferences
